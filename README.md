# Linked-List-Palindrome
Reverse and compare algorithm for palindrome detection of linked list

Check to see if a Linked List is a palindrome. A palindrome is when a word or phrase is the same thing backwards.
ex: TACO CAT --> TAC OCAT =True (ignore spaces)

For my solution, I created a reversed List of the original and compared both lists to see if it's a palindrome.
